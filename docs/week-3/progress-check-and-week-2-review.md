# Intro to Development II (DEV2001-O)

## Progress Check & Week 2 Review

### Instructions

Please post your response to the following questions as this discussion has a small grade weight associated with it. Also, feel free to reply to other post with your fellow students. I like this to help build a sense of community. There are no wrong answers!

1. What was your biggest challenge relating to the content of week two?
2. Were you able to overcome that challenge and if so, what did you have to do?

### Responses

1. I had a few **challenges** this week. One ongoing challenge of mine while continuing to learn and understand better JavaScript is **maintaining proper syntax, structure, and scope**. This is just an ongoing challenge that I know will get better over time naturally by practicing. Another challenge was simply **understanding how to use various parts of the code in other parts of the code**. I think the last challenge I will speak of is also **writing efficient code and knowing how to do so properly**. I can tell there is most likely better ways of doing certain things, but we either have not covered it yet or I am still grasping certain concepts of how to achieve a better level of efficiency with writing my code.
2. I believe I was able **to overcome the challenges** thus far. To do so, I have had to **research constantly, review our provided materials constantly, practice, practice, practice, use trial and error, and maintain good logic and critical thinking**. Repetition is key for me when learning a new language and so is simply the time spent using the language, which has only been about a month and a half at this point.
