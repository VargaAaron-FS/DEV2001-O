### Responses

1. My biggest challenge(s) during week one were pertaining to displaying the data on top of each associated column properly and displaying the average of my data properly. These two tasks were the last problems or tasks I faced before completing the assignment.
2. I was able to overcome the challenges I faced during week one, but not without long hours of hard work and critical thinking. I absolutely had to reach out for help. I asked as many questions as I could. I reviewed and re-read all the information and videos provided to us during the week several times. I did my own independent research on certain topics for further study and acclamation. It was equally important to take breaks when I needed them so that I could try to  maintain a fresh mindset, even though that became hard as our deadlines are always fast approaching due to our accelerated curriculum. That is not an excuse for anything either. I really like that this is a fast-paced program in order to expedite us into the field quicker. It still presents its challenges!
3. Heading into week 2, I expect the challenges to continue. I feel more prepared this week about the material. I feel more "warmed up" for JavaScript and my brain feels more in-tune with the language and syntax after a week of getting back into it all. As always, starting the assignments as early as possible will be crucial to task and time management, so I can allow for questions and time to debug code as needed. I expect to continue to pick up steam and momentum and add to my JavaScript "tool belt," exponentially.
4. Admittedly, I am not huge into Marvel nor DC, but if I had to choose, I would go with DC and say Batman is my favorite character. I really love the *[Batman: The Animated Series (1992 - 1995)](https://www.dccomics.com/tv/batman-the-animated-series-1992-1995)*.
