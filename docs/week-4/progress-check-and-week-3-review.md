### Instructions

Please post your response to the following questions as this discussion has a small grade weight associated with it. Also, feel free to reply to other post with your fellow students. I like this to help build a sense of community. There are no wrong answers!

1. What was your biggest challenge relating to the content of week three?
2. Were you able to overcome that challenge and if so, what did you have to do?

### Responses

1. Our week three assignment presented a lot of fun challenges. I think the biggest challenge for me was testing my final production. As our projects become more and more complex, the amount of tests I can put them through grow exponentially. I was testing vigorously, but even in the latter stages of my testing, I still stumbled upon bugs or issues, no matter how small or big they were, which made me realize how extensive programs are going to actually get and how in-depth testing is going to need to become. I'm sure, in perspective, this was not even a complex program, but it still showed how even a smaller project like this can hold so many tasks and different ways of doing things that if you don't test them all, you will miss a bug or issue that someone else down the line will surely encounter.
2. To overcome this challenge, I took as much time as I could until the deadline came to test my project as well as I could. I caught many bugs and issues with my code and felt proud of my overall accomplishments with this project.
